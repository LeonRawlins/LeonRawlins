I have **15 years professional experience** in building automation. I specialise in the **design**, **development** and **integration** of elegant, informative and responsive front-end's for both public and private sector BAS/BMS.

Experience and accreditation include *but aren't limited to* the following systems, protocols and languages.

- Trend IQVision, IQSET, 963 & 945
- Niagara Framework N4 & AX
- Siemens Desigo CC
- Synapsys Solutions
- BACnet
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript & JSON
- SQL & NoSQL
- XML

Recent working knowledge circles modern web dev technologies, BIM, blockchain and the emerging "smart buildings industry" which incorporates: **semantic tagging**, **telemetry** (analytics/synthetics) and **cloud native computing** solutions.

I am particularly interested in how **immersive media** and **real-tiime location servcies** can be deployed within the built environment to enhance the occupant experience.
